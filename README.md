# Calculator-using-python-
The project "CALCULATOR" application is built using the python programming language with GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI) .

With this calculator application, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide numbers. You can also find values of trigonometric functions (sin, cosine, tan), logarithmic function (to base ‘e’), exponential function and convert radians to degrees, degrees to radians. It has a clear and backspace functions as well. The end result of the simple calculator system is its ability to process numbers and operators, and provides a useful result. 
We have used two modules to create this simple scientific calculator. 
1)Tkinter 
2)Math 
Tkinter is the standard GUI(graphical user interface) library for Python. Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. Tkinter has several strengths. It’s a cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run. Although Tkinter is considered the de facto Python GUI framework, it’s not without criticism. One notable criticism is that GUIs built with Tkinter look outdated. 
We used Tkinter to create the calculator window with input field and buttons to perform various operations. 
 Python provides the math module to deal with calculations. It provides functions to deal with both basic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), 
multiplication (*), division (/) and advance operations like trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential functions. Math module provides various the value of 
various constants like pi, tau. Having such constants saves the time of writing the value of each constant every time we want to use it and that too with great 
precision. We used Math module in function definitions of log, sin, cos, tan, radians, degrees and exponent.
